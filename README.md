My name is Apolo and I am an electronic engineering student. Currently, i'm looking for an internship to learn more about technology and live the experiences in the job market.

Since the beginning of graduation (2016) I already had some experience and curiosity to
work with programming and technology development. Upon entering the
college the opportunity to work on extension projects, discipline projects and undergraduate research projects that helped me develop
microcontrollers, synthesizing in VHDL and data processing acquisition (Python). In
parallel to that, recently i incorporated in my projects of system of
Git versioning integrated with GitHub and law to study android development
using a Kotlin programming language and Android Studio IDE. And currently I have been doing personal projects involving the development of API'S RESTful using both Java and NodeJS.
